- This challenge explores earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and creates an interactive map using Leaflet to visualize this data.

Sources:
Used Xpert Learning Assistant to assist me with:

Used AskBCS Learning Assistant to assist me with:
- formatting the legend
Went to office hours with Thomas Bogue to assist me with creating my limits and formatting my legend because both learning assistants were not helpful.

How to run:
- Open the index.html file using LiveServer.
- Click on a marker to see more information about that specific earthquake.
